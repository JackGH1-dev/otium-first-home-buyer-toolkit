## 🔧 Critical Fixes Implemented

### 1. HECS Calculation Methodology
**File:** `src/utils/financialCalculations.js:line_342-348`
```javascript
// BEFORE (incorrect - combined income)
const annualHECSPayment = hasHECS ? calculateHECSRepayment(totalGrossIncome) : 0

// AFTER (correct - individual incomes)
const primaryHECS = hasHECS ? calculateHECSRepayment(primaryIncome) : 0
const secondaryHECS = hasHECS && secondaryIncome > 0 ? calculateHECSRepayment(secondaryIncome) : 0
const annualHECSPayment = primaryHECS + secondaryHECS
```

### 2. Tax Breakdown Data Structure
**File:** `src/utils/financialCalculations.js:line_385-395`
```javascript
// Added individual tax information objects
primaryTaxInfo: {
  grossIncome: primaryIncome,
  incomeTax: primaryTax,
  medicareLevy: primaryMedicare,
  hecsPayment: primaryHECS
},
secondaryTaxInfo: secondaryIncome > 0 ? {
  grossIncome: secondaryIncome,
  incomeTax: secondaryTax,
  medicareLevy: secondaryMedicare,
  hecsPayment: secondaryHECS
} : null
```

### 3. UI State Synchronization
**File:** `src/components/FirstHomeBuyerToolkit/Steps/BorrowingPowerEstimator.jsx:line_286`
```javascript
onChange={(e) => {
  setShowHECS(e.target.checked)
  handleInputChange('hasHECS', e.target.checked) // CRITICAL FIX
  if (!e.target.checked) {
    handleInputChange('primaryHECSBalance', '')
    handleInputChange('secondaryHECSBalance', '')
  }
}}
```
