| 5        | $660,016      | $1.5M+         | -56%         | üö® CRITICAL |
| 6        | $425,720      | $650K - $750K  | -34% to -43% | üö® CRITICAL |

**Analysis Summary:**
- **All 6 scenarios** perform below expected professional ranges
- **3 scenarios** show critical variance (>30% below expected)
- **Average underperformance**: ~35% across all scenarios
- **Systematic issue identified**: Likely in HEM calculations, HECS impact, or core assessment methodology

### üîç **Pattern Analysis - Key Identifiers**

| Factor | Scenarios | Avg Variance | Pattern |
|--------|-----------|--------------|---------|
| **HECS Debt** | 2,3,5,6 (4 scenarios) | -44% | üö® MAJOR IMPACT |
| **No HECS** | 1,4 (2 scenarios) | -14% | ‚ö†Ô∏è Moderate impact |
| **Investment Property** | 2,4,5 (3 scenarios) | -29% | ‚ö†Ô∏è Below expected |
| **Owner-Occupied** | 1,3,6 (3 scenarios) | -44% | üö® CRITICAL |

### QED Calculator Testing Protocol
**Standardized Inputs Required:**
- **Interest Rate**: 5.5% (Owner-Occupied) / 5.8% (Investment)
- **Living Expenses**: Use HEM benchmark (auto-calculated by QED)
- **Default Rent**: $650/month when no actual rent (for owner-occupied scenarios)
- **HECS**: Input exact amounts as per scenarios
- **Assessment Rate**: QED auto-calculates (expect ~8.5% OO, ~8.8% INV)
