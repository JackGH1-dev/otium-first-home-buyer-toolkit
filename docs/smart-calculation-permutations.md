# Smart Property Calculator - All Permutations Analysis

## Overview
The Smart Auto-Calculation system handles 6 permutations of 2-input → 2-output scenarios for property calculations.

## Mathematical Foundation
```
Core Relationships:
- Loan Amount = Property Value × (LVR ÷ 100)
- Deposit = Property Value - Loan Amount  
- Funds Available = Deposit + Transaction Costs
- LVR = (Loan Amount ÷ Property Value) × 100

Where Transaction Costs = Stamp Duty + Legal Fees + Inspections + LMI (if LVR > 80%)
```

## Detailed Permutation Analysis

### 1. PROPERTY_FUNDS: Property Value + Funds Available → LVR + Loan Amount
**Input:** User knows the house price and has specific cash available
**Use Case:** "I found a $800k house and have $160k cash"

**Calculation Steps:**
```javascript
// Step 1: Calculate transaction costs
const costs = calculateUpfrontCosts(propertyValue, propertyValue * 0.8, { state, isFirstHomeBuyer, includeLMI: false })

// Step 2: Determine available deposit
const availableForDeposit = fundsAvailable - costs.total

// Step 3: Calculate loan amount
const loanAmount = propertyValue - availableForDeposit

// Step 4: Calculate LVR
const lvr = (loanAmount / propertyValue) * 100
```

**Expected Output Example:**
- Property Value: $800,000 (input)
- Funds Available: $160,000 (input)
- Transaction Costs: ~$40,000
- Available Deposit: $120,000
- Loan Amount: $680,000 ✓
- LVR: 85% ✓

**⚠️ Potential Issue:** Initial cost estimate uses 80% LVR assumption, but final LVR might be different, requiring recalculation.

### 2. PROPERTY_LVR: Property Value + LVR → Loan Amount + Funds Available
**Input:** User targeting specific LVR (e.g., 80% to avoid LMI)
**Use Case:** "I want a $750k house at exactly 80% LVR"

**Calculation Steps:**
```javascript
// Step 1: Calculate loan amount directly
const loanAmount = propertyValue * (lvr / 100)

// Step 2: Calculate required deposit
const depositAmount = propertyValue - loanAmount

// Step 3: Calculate transaction costs with known LVR
const costs = calculateUpfrontCosts(propertyValue, loanAmount, { 
  state, isFirstHomeBuyer, includeLMI: lvr > 80 
})

// Step 4: Calculate total funds needed
const fundsAvailable = depositAmount + costs.total
```

**Expected Output Example:**
- Property Value: $750,000 (input)
- LVR: 80% (input)
- Loan Amount: $600,000 ✓
- Deposit: $150,000 ✓
- Transaction Costs: ~$35,000
- Funds Available: $185,000 ✓

**✅ Status:** Most reliable calculation - direct mathematical relationship.

### 3. FUNDS_LVR: Funds Available + LVR → Property Value + Loan Amount
**Input:** User knows cash available and desired LVR
**Use Case:** "I have $150k cash and want 80% LVR"

**Calculation Steps:**
```javascript
// Step 1: ESTIMATE costs as 5% (POTENTIAL ISSUE HERE)
const estimatedCostRate = 0.05 
const availableForDeposit = fundsAvailable / (1 + estimatedCostRate)

// Step 2: Calculate property value from LVR
const depositRate = (100 - lvr) / 100
const propertyValue = availableForDeposit / depositRate

// Step 3: Calculate loan amount
const loanAmount = Math.min(propertyValue * (lvr / 100), borrowingPower)

// Step 4: Recalculate with ACTUAL costs
const costs = calculateUpfrontCosts(propertyValue, loanAmount, { ... })
const actualFundsNeeded = propertyValue - loanAmount + costs.total
```

**Expected Output Example:**
- Funds Available: $150,000 (input)
- LVR: 80% (input)
- Estimated Property Value: ~$714,000
- Loan Amount: ~$571,000
- **After recalculation with actual costs:** Values may shift significantly

**⚠️ Major Issue:** The 5% cost estimate can be very inaccurate. Real costs vary from 3-8% depending on price, state, and LMI.

### 4. LOAN_PROPERTY: Loan Amount + Property Value → LVR + Funds Available
**Input:** User knows borrowing capacity and found a property
**Use Case:** "Bank approved $600k loan, checking $750k property"

**Calculation Steps:**
```javascript
// Step 1: Calculate LVR directly
const lvr = (loanAmount / propertyValue) * 100

// Step 2: Calculate required deposit
const depositAmount = propertyValue - loanAmount

// Step 3: Calculate transaction costs
const costs = calculateUpfrontCosts(propertyValue, loanAmount, { 
  state, isFirstHomeBuyer, includeLMI: lvr > 80 
})

// Step 4: Calculate total funds needed
const fundsAvailable = depositAmount + costs.total
```

**Expected Output Example:**
- Loan Amount: $600,000 (input)
- Property Value: $750,000 (input)
- LVR: 80% ✓
- Deposit Required: $150,000 ✓
- Transaction Costs: ~$35,000
- Funds Available: $185,000 ✓

**✅ Status:** Reliable - straightforward mathematical relationship.

### 5. LOAN_LVR: Loan Amount + LVR → Property Value + Funds Available
**Input:** User knows loan capacity and desired LVR
**Use Case:** "Bank approved $600k, want exactly 80% LVR"

**Calculation Steps:**
```javascript
// Step 1: Calculate property value from LVR
const propertyValue = loanAmount / (lvr / 100)

// Step 2: Calculate deposit
const depositAmount = propertyValue - loanAmount

// Step 3: Calculate costs
const costs = calculateUpfrontCosts(propertyValue, loanAmount, { ... })

// Step 4: Calculate total funds needed  
const fundsAvailable = depositAmount + costs.total
```

**Expected Output Example:**
- Loan Amount: $600,000 (input)
- LVR: 80% (input)
- Property Value: $750,000 ✓
- Deposit: $150,000 ✓
- Funds Available: $185,000 ✓

**✅ Status:** Reliable - direct calculation.

### 6. LOAN_FUNDS: Loan Amount + Funds Available → Property Value + LVR
**Input:** User knows loan capacity and available cash
**Use Case:** "Bank approved $600k loan, I have $150k cash"

**Calculation Steps:**
```javascript
// Step 1: Estimate initial property value (80% LVR guess)
let propertyValue = loanAmount * 1.25

// Step 2: ITERATIVE REFINEMENT (up to 10 iterations)
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  const costs = calculateUpfrontCosts(propertyValue, loanAmount, { ... })
  const depositAmount = propertyValue - loanAmount
  const totalFundsNeeded = depositAmount + costs.total
  
  // Step 3: Check if close enough to target
  if (Math.abs(totalFundsNeeded - fundsAvailable) < $1000) break
  
  // Step 4: Adjust property value proportionally
  propertyValue = propertyValue * (fundsAvailable / totalFundsNeeded)
}

// Step 5: Calculate final LVR
const lvr = (loanAmount / propertyValue) * 100
```

**Expected Output Example:**
- Loan Amount: $600,000 (input)  
- Funds Available: $150,000 (input)
- After iterations: Property Value: ~$715,000
- Final LVR: ~84%

**⚠️ Potential Issues:** 
- May not converge in 10 iterations for extreme cases
- Initial 80% LVR assumption may be far off
- Could oscillate around the solution

## Summary of Issues Found

### **High Priority Fixes:**

1. **FUNDS_LVR Strategy** - Replace 5% cost estimate with iterative approach like LOAN_FUNDS
2. **PROPERTY_FUNDS Strategy** - Should recalculate costs with actual LVR, not assumed 80%
3. **Borrowing Power Constraints** - When loan amount exceeds borrowing power, should clearly indicate this override to user

### **Medium Priority Improvements:**

4. **Convergence Tolerance** - Increase iterations or improve convergence algorithm for LOAN_FUNDS
5. **Home Guarantee Scheme** - Integrate scheme checking consistently across all strategies
6. **Cost Accuracy** - Use more sophisticated cost estimation based on property value brackets

### **Current Accuracy Assessment:**

- **PROPERTY_LVR**: 95% accurate ✅
- **LOAN_PROPERTY**: 95% accurate ✅  
- **LOAN_LVR**: 95% accurate ✅
- **PROPERTY_FUNDS**: 85% accurate ⚠️ (cost estimation issue)
- **LOAN_FUNDS**: 80% accurate ⚠️ (convergence issues)
- **FUNDS_LVR**: 70% accurate ❌ (major cost estimation issue)

The system handles all mathematical permutations but needs refinement in cost estimation for maximum accuracy.
